WARNING:LIT:563 - PLL_ADV symbol "clk25_24/pll_base_inst" (output
   signal=clk25_24/clkout0) has attribute CLK_FEEDBACK set to value CLKFBOUT. It
   will be ignored when retargeting the PLL_ADV into MMCM. 
WARNING:LIT:701 - PAD symbol "rst" has an undefined IOSTANDARD.
WARNING:LIT:702 - PAD symbol "rst" is not constrained (LOC) to a specific
   location.

INFO:Place:834 - Only a subset of IOs are locked. Out of 30 IOs, 15 are locked
   and 15 are not locked. If you would like to print the names of these IOs,

ERROR:Place:1398 - A clock IOB / BUFGCTRL clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGCTRL site pair. The clock
   IOB component <CAM_PCLK> is placed at site <H4>. The corresponding BUFGCTRL
   component <CAM_PCLK_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGCTRL_X0Y3>. The clock
   IO can use the fast path between the IOB and the Clock Buffer if the IOB is
   placed on a Clock Capable IOB site that has dedicated fast path to BUFGCTRL
   sites in its half of the device (TOP or BOTTOM). You may want to analyze why
   this problem exists and correct it. If this sub optimal condition is
   acceptable for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint
   in the .ucf file to demote this message to a WARNING and allow your design to
   continue. However, the use of this override is highly discouraged as it may
   lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition
   be corrected in the design. A list of all the COMP.PINs used in this clock
   placement rule is listed below. These examples can be used directly in the
   .ucf file to override this clock rule.
   < NET "CAM_PCLK" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE; >
